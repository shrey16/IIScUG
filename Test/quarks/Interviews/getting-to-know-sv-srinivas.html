				<p>Professor S.V. Srinivas taught the “Ways of Seeing” and the “Ways of Knowing” course for the batches until the class of 2018.</p>
<h1>When and how were you approached for recruitment into the programme?</h1>
				<p>
					I came to know about the teaching opportunity in December 2012, from a visiting professor at CCS. I wrote to Prof. Gadagkar expressing my interest. He was aware of my qualifications and my areas of research because I was part of some earlier CCS initiatives. The conversation with Prof. Gadagkar was carried out in the early part of 2013 over email (since I was then in the USA). Details of the oﬀer were finalized in June and I formally joined the programme on 1st August 2013.
				</p>
<h1>What were the most important things that you think a student would have gained from your course?</h1>
				<p>
					Levels of engagement of students were very different so it is difficult to generalize. A few students were indifferent throughout the year, some showed interested in particular units while some others were engaged during both semesters. On the whole, in UH 101, it would not be an exaggeration to say that a majority of students were being introduced to Humanities as areas of knowledge production. By the end of the course, they seemed to have understood that knowledge production is not limited to the sciences and got some sense of what is there to study in humanities subjects in general and Literature, History and Anthropology in particular. In UH 102, the challenge was to relate concepts to practice. Students did quite well as far as practice was concerned. They produced original literary (science fiction) and video works and in the process made connections between concepts they studied and creative work. An important takeaway from UH 102 is that literary and artistic works are products of labour and are carefully (painstakingly) assembled. Stories can be told in multiple ways and, consequently, the world seen differently.
				</p>
<h1>What did you like about the students and their response to your course? In what respects do you think the students could have used improvement?</h1>
				<p>
					Students participated actively in classroom discussions and were enthusiastic about doing projects, which were group activities. The classes generated wonderful stories and films although most students had not done either creative writing or made video films earlier. On the downside, students often came to class without reading the course materials. Most groups did not seek or value feedback from their peers, much as I encouraged them to share their works in progress in class. Instead they came to me for my feedback and suggestions. 
				</p>
<h1>Were you satisfied with the time allotted to the module? (For example, are there some things that you couldn’t complete because of lack of time?)</h1>
				<p>
<ol>
<li>I wish we had an activity or lab slot for at least a couple of hours every week. Although I used the TA sessions for writing practice in the first semester and discussion of projects in the second, a longer activity slot would have allowed us to do more and the courses would have been more enjoyable too.
<li>The class had several students who needed some additional support in English language comprehension and writing but also with course materials, which they were having difficulties following. Weekly tutorials would have helped such students.
</ol>

				</p>
<h1>You taught the 2014-18 batch for two semesters. What are some things that changed from the starting to the end?</h1>
				<p>
					On the whole students turned in excellent end-semester projects in the second term. This was partly due to high level of interest the entire class showed in the module on film, which came at the end of the course. At the same time, it is likely that students were drawing on what they had learnt in the first two semesters to bring to the project a better understanding of the problem (namely, cities and their representation).
				</p>
<h1>How does your course fit in with the rest of the UG humanities course?</h1>
<p>The first two UG humanities courses are closely related to each other by design. There are multiple cross references within each course and also across these two courses. I was fortunate to have taught all the modules of both courses. As a result, I was able to integrate the modules better, anticipate and also flag connections between the modules and courses. Since I was not a part of the Humanities teaching team after 2015 July, I don’t know what other courses were offered. I will therefore not comment on the fit with the rest of the courses.</p>

<h1>Is there anything else you would like to add about your experience teaching these modules?</h1>
<p>It was a valuable learning experience for me. I enjoyed teaching both the courses immensely.</p>
